          I&apos;m having a few friends over to my place
          for drinks.
          Think small gathering rather than big party.
          (Partly because it means I might get to talk to everyone,
          but also because it&apos;s my house and there are only a limited
          number of chairs here.)
        </P>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          There will be snacks on hand, but not a full sit down meal.
          You may want to eat dinner before you get here. If it&apos;s helpful
          I can give you a list of nice restaurants within a short walk.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          You don&apos;t need to bring anything.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          It will be more helpful to volunteer to pop round the corner
          for extra ice after a while, which in fact might well run out.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          There will be plenty
          to drink, we are extremely unlikely to run out. Sometimes
          you can tell people this and they decide to insist anyway.
          If that&apos;s you but you&apos;re not sure what, any of
          <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/WMAS4G82A627?ref_=wl_share" target="_blank">
            these are great</a>, a spare bottle
          will get consumed at some party,
          even if we don&apos;t open a fresh bottle at this one.
          <br />
          (Convenient way to make a list, not a shopping service recommendation per se.)
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          But seriously, there is no need to bring anything, just show up.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          Don&apos;t know anything about cocktails?
          <br />
          No problem, there will
          be plenty of suggestions.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          You&apos;re really into cocktails and fancy something obscure, fiddly
          or requiring preparation?
          <br />
          Awesome. Drop me a line to chat about it.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          You don&apos;t drink booze, and would like to know if that&apos;s fine?
          <br />
          Yes, obviously.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          Any other questions, do send them my way.
